# Open Bounty: Build your own yield farming strategy on Polygon

## The Bounty

We have created this open bounty where developers can participate by automating any DeFi strategy of their choice. The ask is to build one or a set of smart contracts that facilitate programmatically yield farming of the selected investment strategy and yields the highest APY possible.

### The context

We think that bringing DeFi investment strategies to non-technical users is essential to drive adoption. That's why we have created this bounty where you can work with other developers to automate complex strategies that allow users to easily bring funds into a vault and start getting earnings right away.

### Requirements

The only requirement is that you build your smart contracts on the Polygon network. Building a frontend component to it is not mandatory but can help you earn more points.

## Resources

- [Polygon developer docs](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/getting-started)
- Anatomy of [a smart contract](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/anatomy/)
- [Deploy a smart contract on ethereum](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-simply-deploy-a-smart-contract-on-ethereum-714c692e00c)
- [This guide](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/remix/) will show you how to deploy a smart contract on the Polygon network leveraging Metamask and the IDE Remix. It's useful if you don't have any experience with Polygon or Solidity.
- A [quick list](https://medium.com/stakingbits/guide-to-yield-farming-with-aave-on-polygon-matic-network-a03bd2154275) of the development tools that you can leverage. We recommend however the setup described above.
- [Yield Farming on Aave on Polygon](https://medium.com/stakingbits/guide-to-yield-farming-with-aave-on-polygon-matic-network-a03bd2154275) to get an idea of how yield farming strategies work

## **What makes a submission complete?**

- A one-pager/diagram (PDF, Slidedeck etc) describing the strategy
- Link to a public Github repository containing the code, team members, presentations, demo and documentation
- Projects cannot be edited after submission.

## Winning Criteria

Projects will be rated from 1 to 5 (5 being the highest) for each of the individual points and add them all to create a final score. In case of a tie, the optional criteria below will decide which submission wins.

- How high is the submission's APY?
- How easy is it for a non-technical user to use this?
- Hoy automated is the submission? Are there manual steps in-between?
- Are there any obvious security issue with the contracts?
- **Optional:** Does the submission have a frontend component? How usable is it?

## Judges

We have asked members of our community to participate as judges. They will use the criteria described above to rank all submissions. We will announce the winners shortly after the submission deadline.
